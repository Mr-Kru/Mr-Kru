### JMP Projects

- [HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS]
Data file: Lab6_Beer Data.jmp
Used a Standardize data and Centroid method to run Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
with all four continuous variables as dependent variables & Brand as label.  

  Findings  
  Summary tables with Mean values for the ingredients was identified. Each cluster was interpreted accordingly. K-means cluster analysis was run with all four         continuous variables. The values of Cluster Cubic Criterion were identified.

- [DECISION TREE ANALYSIS]  
Data File: Lab5_Credit Card Marketing.jmp  
A bank would like to understand the demographics and other characteristics associated with whether a customer accepts a credit card offer. Observational data is somewhat limited for this kind of problem, in that often the company sees only those who respond to an offer. To get around this, the bank designs a focused marketing study, with 18,000 current bank customers. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the offer, and to use existing demographic data that is already available on each customer. 

  The designed approach also allows the bank to control for other potentially important factors so that the offer combination isn’t confused or confounded with the     demographic factors. Because of the size of the data and the possibility that there are complex relationships between the response and the studied factors, a         decision tree is used to find out if there is a smaller subset of factors that may be more important and that warrant further analysis and study.

  The Task   
  You want to build a classification model that will provide insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers and others don’t. Because the response is   categorical (either Yes or No) and we have a large number of potential predictor variables, we use the Partition platform to build a Decision Tree for Offer         Accepted. We are primarily interested in understanding characteristics of customers who have accepted an offer, so the resulting model will be exploratory in         nature.

  Findings  
  A Decision Tree analysis was performed with ‘Offer Accepted’ as the dependent variable, all other variables (except Customer Number) as independent variables and     ‘Validation’ as   Validation column. The ideal number of splits was identified, sensitivity and specificity rates for Validation set were determined, rules of probability were found, prediction profiler was visualized.
