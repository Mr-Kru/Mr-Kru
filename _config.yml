  With a decade of experience in Data Analytics, Educational Management, and Oil & Gas, including international projects, I'm currently a Fulbright Scholar pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics with a focus on Information Systems Management. My strong technical skills in Python, C#, R, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, Database Management, MongoDB, and JMP, coupled with a Master's in Engineering and Shipping Operations, enable me to translate complex data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making and process optimization. I'm eager to contribute my expertise in Data/Business Analytics to drive innovation and growth.  <br>
